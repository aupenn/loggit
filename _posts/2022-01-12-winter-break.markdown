Albeit a bit late, 2021 was a busy year. During the holidays, my family had caught COVID. However, my family was determined to enjoy 
our time together. We spent a large amount of time building festive puzzles, competiting with various board games, decorating cookies together, and more.

In addition to the various activities I mentioned, my family also watched a few films. I missed the majority of these films. However, I joined my family for one movie
of my choice. 

On a whim, I chose a film that a friend casually recommended and I believe it has become one of my favorite movies.

The film is called **12 Angry Men (1957)**. 

I was unfamiliar with this film upon finding it. I was not aware it frequently was listed on lists listing the "best films of all time." 
After watching it, I find myself to list it among my favorites as well. As you likely would gather off the title, the film is largely compelling
because of its characters. The characters themselves feel like legitimate people as they battle it out just over an hour and a half. Throughout the film's length,
they largely find themselves coming to terms with the decision they have to make and the responsibilty they've been trusted with. The various perspectives and mindsets
at play throughout the film make it a compelling drama and one I could easily recommend. Frankly, I find it to be a must-watch and would encourage you to place it 
at the top of your watchlist.
