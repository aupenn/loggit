I have compiled a list of games to share with friends. I plan on revising this and then re-writing this list, providing more details and possibly going more in-depth. Nonetheless, if you find yourself staring at your game library unsure of what to play and unsure what to purchase in the store, take a look through this list.
Many of these games will be older and feature clunky controls, mechanics, or a variety of other things that make it seem very dated. Despite that, I encourage you to view it as a product of its time and simply resist the urge to compare it to games released in the present year with years of refined technology, techniques, and design philosophy. Many of these titles have had an influence on games released today and you may be surprised to learn how many have influenced major titles you know today. 

I have gone ahead and categorized a variety of games as well as provided descriptions on each game. A few will provide links to YouTube ""reviews"" that summarize the game well without providing spoilers (at least, without warning). 

______
### Horror Games
Horror is a very broad genre. As such, I've only listed items that have notable horror elements (in which it is something re-occurring for a notable portion of the game, not just a one-off sequence).

### ARPG Games

* **[Grim Dawn](https://www.gog.com/en/game/grim_dawn)**
> Recommend playing with DLC as it adds new features, not just new content to play through. Very akin to Diablo 2

* **[Diablo 1](https://www.gog.com/en/game/diablo)**
> Embark on this eerie quest as you journey down through an abandoned monastary battling the endless hordes of demons. You are able to play as three different classes and find gear for each. Features online co-op. 

### Action-Adventure

* **[Alan Wake](https://www.gog.com/en/game/alan_wake)**
> Suffering from a two-year strain of writer's block, best-selling writer Alan Wake is brought on vacation by his wife Alice to the town of Bright Falls. However, everything at Bright Falls isn't quite as it seems and something is more sinister at play resulting in his wife's disappearance. This third-person shooter has a great atmosphere and unique storyline. 

* **[Control Ultimate Edition](https://www.gog.com/en/game/control_ultimate_edition)**
> It is heavily inspired by the online horror community the SCP Foundation. Follow Jesse Faden in this third-person shooter as she arrives at the Federal Bureau of Control attempting to stop and contain the ominous and otherworldly beings wrecking havoc.

* **[Max Payne]()**
* **[Max Payne 2]()**
* **[Hellpoint]()**

### FPS

* **[Metro Series](https://www.gog.com/en/game/metro_franchise_bundle)**
> Linear FPS series (with the exception of Exodus being more open). 
 
* **[FEAR](https://www.gog.com/en/game/fear_platinum)**
> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z-oSpuIhw4)

* **[S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow of Chernobyl](https://www.gog.com/game/stalker_shadow_of_chernobyl)**
> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTq4ibgVof8). Explore the Zone where anomalies occur and everyone battles for control. All the games in this series have a reputation for having some stability issues. 

* **[S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripiyat](https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_call_of_pripyat)**
> Explore the Zone where anomalies occur and everyone battles for control. The sequel to Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl. 

### Survival Horror

* **[Dead Space 1](https://www.gog.com/en/game/dead_space)**
> [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8ue7RnUdd4). Evidently 2 is not on GOG for some reason? Maybe the micro-transactions?

* **[The Evil Within 1](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_evil_within)**
> Play through this RE4-esque survival horror game. Disable letterbox in the settings (the black bars on the bottom and top). 

* **[The Evil Within 2](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_evil_within_2)**

### Survival 
* **[Darkwood](https://www.gog.com/en/game/darkwood)**
> [Darkwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mQEhl6GXvM) is a top-down horror survival game in which you must scavenge and explore the ever ominous and terrifying forest. During the day, you will find yourself desperately scavening for supplies. At night, you will hunker down in whatever shelter you have and pray that you will survive until sunrise. That is if the deadly horrors at night don't find and kill you first. Darkwood has an incredibly creepy and ominous atmosphere providing tension and anxiety frequently. 

### Old-School Shooters
Old-School shooters may have a story, but they largely focus on their level design, enemies, and gameplay. 

* **[Quake 1](https://www.gog.com/en/game/quake_the_offering)**
> Quake 1 is an incredibly influential old-school shooter created by the makers of Doom. Play as a marine taking on eldritch threats. 

* **[Blood: Fresh Supply](https://www.gog.com/en/game/blood_fresh_supply)** 
> Rise from the grave in this old-person shooter to battle an endless horde of cultists, zombies, gargoyles, hellhounds, and various other horrors. Note that this shooter is fairly difficult. Be warned! Features online multiplayer.

* **[Dusk](https://www.gog.com/en/game/dusk)**
> In [this Quake-like old-school shooter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSv43cB6aME), blast your way through the endless backwater culstists, possessed militants, and otherworldly threats.

* **[Ion Fury]()**

* **[Homeworld Emergence](https://www.gog.com/en/game/homeworld_emergence)**
> RTS. A sequel to the first Homeworld (despite there being a Homeworld 2). Homeworld 2 was developed by a different studio and they took the story in a different direction than the original team was planning on taking it. This title is horror-oriented with a eerie threat. Fantastic voice acting.
